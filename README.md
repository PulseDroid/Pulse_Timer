<i>The most minimalistic compass app around!</i>

This minimalistic Timer app was made Graphics Designer new to the app development scene, 
<b>thus it is very clean.</b> I've utilized most of Android's framework, making this app fit right in!
The timer runs in the background and <b>a pop-up will notify you when your timer is done</b>,
that accompanied by a notification sound and vibration will make sure you don't miss it!
